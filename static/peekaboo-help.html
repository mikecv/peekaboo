         <h1>Peek-A-Boo</h1>
         <a id="Introduction"></a>
         <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <p>Steganography is the art of hiding in plain sight.
         This application is about hiding information in an electronic image, and in plain sight
         in this case by embedding information in variations in the colour of the image pixels.
         </p>
         <p>The more information that is hidden in the image, the more obvious the variations
         in pixel colour becomes. Not that the the information itself is exposed, but rather
         that the modified image has been compromised, that is, it may look altered. For this reason
         the amount of data embedded in the image should be restricted to avoid overly compromising
         the original image.
         </p>

         <a id="Overview"></a>
         <h2>Overview</h2>
         <p>There are basically two functions that the application performs. Firstly, embedding
         a file or files into an image and saving the resultant image, and secondly,
         being able to detect that an image has embedded data and being able to extract and save
         the embedded data.
         </p>
         <p>There are a number of limitations with this application of Steganography, a key one
         being that the original images if compressed must use lossless compression.
         For this reason only PNG images are accepted as images to embed data into. While there
         are other lossless image formats, PNG was chosen in the first instance. Other formats
         may be supported in the future. In addition to the PNG image format being supported,
         only the colour information is used, that is, a transparency layer is not used,
         whether present or not.
         </p>
         <p>
         Interestingly, if the original image is sufficiently compressed (losslessly), it is
         possible to embed the image into itself. Addmittedly, the resultant image may end
         up less compressed and be of a larger file size than the original. Once extracted,
         the embedded image will be identical to the original image. While this is possible,
         it may however be obvious that the image containing the embedded image has been modified.
         </p>

         <a id="Uploading"></a>
         <h2>Uploading</h2>
         <p>The first step before embedding files into an image, or extracting embedded files
         from an image, is to upload the source image. Images used to embed files must be
         lossless images, and currently only PNG images are supported.
         </p>
         <p>The first step is to browse to the source image, which could be an encodded image,
         or it could be an image you want to embed files into. Either way you start by selecting
         the <i><b>"Browse for Image"</i></b> button.
         Note that any time that the <i><b>"Browse for Image"</i></b> button is displayed,
         it can be selected to reset the application to starting conditions, i.e. it can be used
         to abort in-progress embed or extract workflows. Note that it makes no difference if
         embedding files into an already encodded image or one that has never been encoded.
         </p>
         <p class="images">
         <img src="/static/help-pics/browseImage.png" alt="Browse for image.">
         </p>
         <p>On browsing to a vaid image file as described above, an <i><b>"Upload"</b></i> button
         will be presented to upload the image for analysis as illustrated below.
         In the figure a thumbnail of the image selected is shown above the
         <i><b>"Upload"</b></i> button along with the name of the file.
         Note that <i>clicking</i> on the browsed image will open the image in a new browser window.
         </p>
         <p class="images">
            <img src="/static/help-pics/uploadControl.png" alt="Upload image for analysis.">
         </p>
         <p>Should other than a PNG file be selected a dialog will prompt the user to select
         a PNG file and return so that the <i><b>"Browse for Image"</i></b> workflow can be
         resumed.
         </p>
         <p>With the starting PNG image browsed to, the user can select the <i><b>"Upload"</b></i> button.
         The <i><b>"Upload"</b></i> button uploads the image to the application where the image
         is analysed. Analysed here means determining if the image file is already embedded with
         data, or is not known to be encoded. The outcome of the analysis determines whether
         embedding and/or extraction workflows can be performed.
         </p>

         <a id="Unencoded Images"></a>
         <h3>Unencoded Images</h3>
         <p>As the name suggests an unencoded image is a PNG image file that has not been encoded
         by the application, that is, it does not contain files that can be extracted.
         Browsing to, and then uploading an unencoded image file will result in analysis showing that the
         image is suitable to have files embeded into it as illustrated below.
         </p>
         <p class="images">
            <img src="/static/help-pics/unencodedImage.png" alt="Uploaded image is unencoded.">
         </p>
         <p>In the example above of uploading an unencoded image we see a number of things, namely:
            <ul>
               <li>The image file is not encoded.</li>
               <li>As a result, the image file is not password protected.</li>
               <li>The embedding capacity of the image is some 45+ MB.</li>
            </ul>
         </p>
         <p>Being unencoded, it means that the image is suitable for embedding, hence only the
         <i><b>"Embed"</b></i> button is available. Note also, the grey border around the analysis
         results data indicating that the uploaded image is not encoded.
         </p>

         <a id="Encoded Images"></a>
         <h3>Encoded Images</h3>
         <p>As the name suggests an encoded image is a PNG image file that has been encoded
         by the application, that is, it ontains one or more files that can be extracted.
         Browsing to, and then uploading an encoded image will result in analysis showing that the
         image both contains data for extraction and that it is suitable to have files encoded into it as illustrated below.
         </p>
         <p class="images">
            <img src="/static/help-pics/encodedImage.png" alt="Uploaded image is encoded.">
         </p>
         <p>In the example above of uploading an encoded image we see a number of things, namely:
            <ul>
               <li>The image file is encoded.</li>
               <li>The image file in this case is not password protected. Note that could be.</li>
               <li>The embedding capacity of the file is some 2.7+ MB.</li>
            </ul>
         </p>
         <p>Being encoded, it means that the image currently has embedded data, and is also suitable for embedding,
         hence both the <i><b>"Embed"</b></i> and <i><b>"Extract"</b></i> buttons are available.
         Note also, the green border around the analysis results data indicating that the uploaded image is encoded.
         </p>

         <a id="Embedding"></a>
         <h2>Embedding</h2>
         <p>While the file to host the embedded data is constrained to be a PNG image file,
         files embedded into the host image file can be of any type.
         </p>
         <p>So any type of file can be embedded, and files of any size can be embedded.
         The only proviso is that the collective size of all the files is within the embedding
         capacity of the host image, noting that the embedding capacity is a function of the
         number of pixels, colour planes, and colour plain depth of the host image.
         For example, for a 600x400 pixel image with 8 bit RGB colour depth, the embedding
         capacity of the image is:
         </p>
         <p class="eq">
         (600 x 400) pixels x 3 colours/pixel x 1 byte/colour = 720,000 bytes
         </p>
         <p>The embedding capacity will be less than that quoted above as some of the capacity
         is used up to store details of the embedded files, e.g. number of files, size of
         each file, the filenames etc. Additionally, you may not want to use the full
         capacity as the more data that is embedded the higher the potential that changes
         to the host image will be noticeable.
         </p>

         <a id="Embedding Example"></a>
         <h3>Embeddding Example</h3>
         <p>We start by uploading our base PNG image, and as per the previous section the uploading
         process results in displaying the embedding capacity of the image as illustrated below.
         </p>
         <p class="images">
            <img src="/static/help-pics/uploadedImage.png" alt="Uploaded image to encode.">
         </p>
         <p>In this example the uploaded image is not already encoded, and has an encoding
         capacity of 4,493,589 Bytes. As we'll show later, this is the absolute maximum that
         can be encoded in this base image, and in reality, using more than half this capacity
         will be visibly noticeable in the resultant image.
         </p>
         <p> The first step in the process is to press the <i><b>"Embed"</b></i> button.
         Doing so will present a button to browse for files to embed as illustrated in the
         figure below.
         </p>
         <p class="images">
            <img src="/static/help-pics/embedbutton.png" alt="Embed button pressed.">
         </p>
         <p> Pressing the <i><b>"Browse for Files to Embed"</b></i> button will open the default
         file browser and allow the selection of 1 or more files as illustrated in the figure below.
         </p>
         <p class="images">
            <img src="/static/help-pics/embeddingGreenFiles.png" alt="Embedding < 35% capacity.">
         </p>
         <p> There are a few interesting pieces of information in the previous image, namely:
            <ul>
               <li>The files selected and their file sizes are listed.</li>
               <li>The remaining embedding capacity, in this case 83.2% is updated in the results text.</li>
               <li>The green border on the results text indicates more than 65% remaining capacity.</li>
            </ul>
         </p>
         <p> At this point the user can repeat the process and select additional files to embed,
         or they can select the <i><b>"Sumbit"</b></i> button to embed all the files currently listed.
         Selecting the <i><b>"Submit"</b></i> button will present the user with a dialog where
         they can specify a password to protect the embedding as illustrated in the figure below.
         </p>
         <p class="images">
            <img src="/static/help-pics/embedPassword.png" alt="Password protection dialog.">
         </p>
         <p>Note that the user can opt for no password protection by submitting a blank password.
         On submitting the password dialog the embedding process will be run. As this may take
         some time, depending on how much data is to be embedded, a 'wait spinner' will be displayed.
         </p>
         <p>On completion of the embedding process the result will be presented, including a thumbnail
         of the image embedded with the previously selected files as illustrated in the figure below.
         </p>
         <p class="images">
            <img src="/static/help-pics/embeddingDone.png" alt="Embedding process complete.">
         </p>
         <p> If all went well, the result will be a success, and the image embedded with the files
         will not be <i>noticably</i> different from the original uploaded image. Note that selecting
         the resultant image will display the image in a new browser page for more closer inspection.
         </p>

         <a id="Embedding Limits"></a>
         <h3>Capacity vs Quality</h3>
         <p> In the example in the previous section the embedding capacity used was only 16.8%
          (remaining capacity of 83.2%), and was in the green, or safe zone, where the green zone
         extendes from 100% down to 65% remaining capacity. As previously noted this is considered
         the safe zone, i.e. the final embedded image is expected to not be noticeably different fron
         the original image.
         </p>
         <p>If we try and embed more data into the image we'll enter the orange zone, where remaining capacity
         is between 65% and 50%. In the example illustrated below we have embedded more data
         into the image.
         </p>
         <p class="images">
            <img src="/static/help-pics/embeddingAmberFiles.png" alt="Embedding in the orange zone.">
         </p>
         <p>In this example we are down at a remaining capacity of 53%, and are now at the bottom end of
         the orange medium zone. That is, we expect to see some evidence of corruption of the original image.
         </p>
         <p class="images">
            <img src="/static/help-pics/MT-blended-53pc.png" alt="Remaining capacity 53%.">
         </p>
         <p> The image shows a split view of before and after embedding, where the left half of the
         image is the original, and the right half is the resultant image after embedding. If you look
         at the right half of the image you can see areas where the colour is washed out. That said,
         distortion is more visible where areas of the image are the same colour, e.g. in the background
         or on parts of Margaret's cheek. In areas of finer detail like the hair and facial features
         the distortion is not as obvious.
         </p>
         <p> We can see this even more in the following example where the embedding has been pushed to
         38.8% capacity remaining. Notice that now the border on the results text is red, indicating
         that we are in the zone where we expect more distortion of the image following embedding.
         </p>
         <p class="images">
            <img src="/static/help-pics/embeddingRedFiles.png" alt="Embedding in the red zone.">
         </p>
         <p>If we look at a split view once again we see that the right half of the image has even
         more spots where the image colour is clearly modified, and these modifications are more
         pronounced.
         </p>
         <p class="images">
            <img src="/static/help-pics/MT-blended-39pc.png" alt="Remaining capacity 39%.">
         </p>
         <p>The embedding algorithm used targets the least significant bits of the image pixel data first,
         and moves to more and more significant bits as the embedding capacity is used. As you reach the
         capacity limits the aberration of the colour detail of the image is more pronounced.
         </p>
         <p>The recommendation then is to stay within the green and orange zones of embedding
         capacity. The impact of embedding data will be less in some emages and with different data
         being embedded so there is no hard and fast limit.
         </p>

         <a id="Compression"></a>
         <h3>Image Compression</h3>
         <p> After embedding data into an image it is likely that the filesize of the new image
         will have increased. As only PNG files can be used (at this point) you can manually used
         image compression software to see if compression can reduce the filesize.
         Note that as the compression is lossless, and that the data embedded into the image is
         included in the compression, the integrity of the data is preserved.
         </p>

         <a id="Nested_Embedding"></a>
         <h3>Nested Embedding</h3>
         <p> An encoded PNG image file, i.e. one embedded with one or more files, is just another
         file, and as such can be embedded into another file as any other file can.
         How deep this nesting can go will depend on the embedding capacity of each 'host' image
         and the physical file sizes of the files embedded into it.
         </p>
         <p> To increase the potential for nesting embedded images it's a good idea to use
         an image compression program to reduce the file size of any encoded images to be included.
         </p>

         <a id="Extracting"></a>
         <h2>Extracting</h2>

         <p> The earlier topics went through embedding data files into images. Here we are
         dealing with extracting the data files from the image they are embedded into, and restoring the files.
         </p>
         <p> As with the embedding process we start with browing to the file containing the embedded images,
         and <i><b>Uploading</b></i> the file for processing. If the uploaded file is encoded the
         <i><b>Extract</b></i> button will be available as illustrated below.
         </p>
         <p class="images">
            <img src="/static/help-pics/embedded-image.png" alt="Embedded image.">
         </p>
         <p> Note that every image that is embedded with data can also be re-imbedded with new data,
         that is, the <i><b>Embed</b></i> button will also be available. In fact, images can be
         embedded with new images over and over again, and it goes without saying that previously
         embedded files are lost.
         </p>
         <p> Note also in the previous image that the upload status indicates that the image is encoded,
         and in this case is not password protected. Additionally, as the <i><b>Embed</b></i> option
         is available the embedding capacity of the image is shown, where the embedding capacity assumes
         that the currently embedded files would be lost.
         </p>

         <p> On pressing the <i><b>Extract</b></i> button the embedded files will be extracted and
         a thumbnail will be shown for each file as illustrated below. The files themselves will be
         saved in the applications's 'secrets' subfolder. Note that if a file of the same name already
         exists a file with a numeric extension will be saved instead so as to preserve the existing file.
         </p>
         <p class="images">
            <img src="/static/help-pics/Extracted-files.png" alt="Extracted files.">
         </p>

         <a id="Extracted_Files"></a>
         <h3>Extracted Files</h3>

         <p> As illustrated in the previous section, a thumbnail is shown for each file extracted,
         and in the case of image files an image thumbnail is shown. Clicking on an image thumbnail
         will open the thumbnail in a new browser page using the default image viewer. The same result
         can be achieved by right clicking the image and selecting the appropriate action from the menu.
         </p>

         <p> Some common file types have matching thumbnails as illustrated in the following image. Other
         file types will be shown with a default thumbnail. Where a file thumbnail (other than an image type)
         is displayed, clicking on the thumbnail will download the file to the default download location.
         </p>
         <p class="images">
            <img src="/static/help-pics/File-types.png" alt="File types.">
         </p>
         <p> Also illustrated in the previous image is that the extracted thumbnails section of the
         page automatically scrolls downwards to show more thumbnails. It is also worthwhile pointing
         out that thumbnails are shown left to right and top to bottom in the order that the
         files are extracted.
         </p>

         <a id="Password_Protection"></a>
         <h3>Password Protection</h3>

         <p> If file embedding includes password protection the user will be prompted to enter
            the set password to enable extraction to complete as illustrated in the image below.
         </p>
         <p class="images">
            <img src="/static/help-pics/password-guess.png" alt="Password entry.">
         </p>
         <p> If the user enters a wrong password a dialog will show them that that is the case,
         and that they have used the first of 3 attempts at password entry as illustrated in
         the following image.

         <h3>Nested Extraction</h3>
         <p> As mentioned in the section on <a href="#Nested_Embedding">Nested Embedding</a>
         an embedded image can also contain embedded images, each with their own embedded
         images, so on and so forth.
         </p>
         <p> The following image shows extracted files from a nested set of embedded images.
         Note that a green border around a thumbnail indicates that the file is an encoded image.
         In this case the extracted files includes 3 encoded images and a number of other images
         at this level.
         </p>
         <p class="images">
            <img src="/static/help-pics/nested-embedding.png" alt="Nested embedding.">
         </p>
         <p> To extract the files from the nested images they should be individually uploaded
         as normal and following the normal extraction procedure. The same applies for any
         further levels of nesting.
         </p>
         <p> Nested encoded images are not extracted iteratively as it would be interactive regardless
         as eached encoded image could be password protected. Also because the depth of encoding is unknown,
         and therefore the time to complete is unknown.
