	<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>Steganography is the art of hiding in plain sight.
		This application is about hiding information in an electronic image, and in plain sight
		in this case by embedding information in variations in the colour of the image pixles.
		</p>
		<p>The more information that is hidden in the image, the more obvious the variations
		in pixel colour becomes. Not that the the information itself is exposed, but rather
		that the modified image has been compromised, that is, it may look altered. For this reason
		the amount of data embedded in the image should be restricted to avoid overly compromising
		the original image.
