         <h1>Peek-A-Boo</h1>
         <a id="Introduction"></a>
         <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <p>Steganography is the art of hiding in plain sight.
         This application is about hiding information in an electronic image, and in plain sight
         in this case by embedding information in variations in the colour of the image pixels.
         </p>
         <p>The more information that is hidden in the image, the more obvious the variations
         in pixel colour becomes. Not that the the information itself is exposed, but rather
         that the modified image has been compromised, that is, it may look altered. For this reason
         the amount of data embedded in the image should be restricted to avoid overly compromising
         the original image.
         </p>

         <a id="Overview"></a>
         <h2>Overview</h2>
         <p>There are basically two functions that the application performs. Firstly embedding
         a file or files into an image and saving the resultant image, and secondly,
         being able to detect that an image has embedded data and being able to extract and save
         these embedded data files.
         </p>
         <p>There are a number of limitations with this application of Steganography, a key one
         being that the original images if compressed must use lossless compression.
         For this reason only PNG images are accepted as images to embed data into. While there
         are other lossless image formats, PNG was chosen in the first instance. Other formats
         may be supported in the future. In addition to the PNG image format being supported,
         only the colour information is used, that is, a transparency layer is not used,
         whether present or not.
         </p>
         <p>
         Interestingly, if the original image is sufficiently compressed (losslessly), it is
         possible to embed the image into itself. Addmittedly, the resultant image may end
         up less compressed and be of a larger file size than the original. Once extracted,
         the embedded image will be identical to the original image. While this is possible,
         it may however be obvious that the image containing the embedded image has been modified.
         </p>

         <a id="Uploading"></a>
         <h2>Uploading</h2>
         <p>The first step before embedding files into an image, or extracting embedded files
         from an image, is to upload the source image. Images used to embed files must be
         lossless images, and currently only PNG images are supported.
         </p>
         <p>The first step is to browse to the source image, which could be an encodded image,
         or it could be an image you want to embed files into. Either way you start by selecting
         the <i><b>"Browse for Image"</i></b> button.
         Note that any time that the "Browse for Image" button is displayed, it can be selected
         to reset the application to starting conditions, i.e. it can be used to abort
         in-progress embed or extract workflows. Note that it makes no difference if embedding
         files into an already encodded image or one that has never been encoded.
         </p>
         <p class="images">
         <img src="/static/help-pics/browseImage.png" alt="Browse for image.">
         </p>
         <p>On browsing to a vaid image file as described above, an <i><b>"Upload"</b></i> button
         will be presented to upload the image for analysis as illustrated below.
         In the figure a thumbnail of the image selected is shown above the
         <i><b>"Upload"</b></i> button along with the name of the file.
         Note that <i>clicking</i> on the browsed image will open the image in a new browser window.
         </p>
         <p class="images">
            <img src="/static/help-pics/uploadControl.png" alt="Upload image for analysis.">
         </p>
         <p>Should other than a PNG file be selected a dialog will prompt the user to select
         a PNG file and return so that the <i><b>"Browse for Image"</i></b> workflow can be
         resumed.
         </p>
         <p>With the starting PNG image browsed to, the user can select the <i><b>"Upload"</b></i> button.
         The <i><b>"Upload"</b></i> button uploads the image to the application where the image
         analysed. Analysed here means determining if the image file is already embedded with
         data, or is not know to be encoded. The outcome of the analysis determines whether
         embedding and/or extraction workflows can be performed.
         </p>

         <a id="Unencoded Images"></a>
         <h3>Uncenoded Images</h3>
         <p>As the name suggests an unencoded image is a PNG image file that has not been encoded
         by the application, that is, it does not contain files that can be extracted.
         Browsing to, and then uploading an unencoded image file will result in analysis showing that the
         image is suitable to have files embeded into it as illustrated below.
         </p>
         <p class="images">
            <img src="/static/help-pics/unencodedImage.png" alt="Uploaded image is unencoded.">
         </p>
         <p>In the example above of uploading an unencoded image we see a number of things, namely:
            <ul>
               <li>The image file is not encoded.</li>
               <li>As a result, the image file is not password protected.</li>
               <li>The embedding capacity of the file is some 45+ MB.</li>
            </ul>
         </p>
         <p>Being unencoded, it means that the image is suitable for embedding, hence only the
         <i><b>"Embed"</b></i> button is available. Note also, the grey border around the analysis
         results data indicating that the uploaded image is not encoded.
         </p>

         <a id="Encoded Images"></a>
         <h3>Encoded Images</h3>
         <p>As the name suggests an coded image is a PNG image file that has been coded
         by the application, that is, it ontains one or more files that can be extracted.
         Browsing to, and then uploading an encoded image file will result in analysis showing that the
         image both contains data for extraction and is suitable to have files embeded into it as illustrated below.
         </p>
         <p class="images">
            <img src="/static/help-pics/encodedImage.png" alt="Uploaded image is encoded.">
         </p>
         <p>In the example above of uploading an encoded image we see a number of things, namely:
            <ul>
               <li>The image file is encoded.</li>
               <li>The image file in this case is password protected. Note that it needn't be.</li>
               <li>The embedding capacity of the file is some 13+ MB.</li>
            </ul>
         </p>
         <p>Being encoded, it means that the image currently has embedded data, and is also suitable for embedding,
         hence both the <i><b>"Embed"</b></i> and <i><b>"Extract"</b></i> buttons are available.
         Note also, the green border around the analysis results data indicating that the uploaded image is encoded.
         </p>

         <a id="Embedding"></a>
         <h2>Embedding</h2>
         <p>While the file to host the embedded data is constrained to be a PNG image file,
         files embedded into the host image file can be of any type.
         </p>
         <p>So any type of file can be embedded, and files of any size can be embedded.
         The only proviso is that collective size of all the files is within the embedding
         capacity of the host image, noting that the embedding capacity is a function of the
         number of pixels, colour planes, and colour plain depth of the host image.
         For example, for a 600x400 pixel image with 8 bit RGB colour depth, the embedding
         capacity of the image is:
         </p>
         <p class="eq">
         (600 x 400) pixels x 3 colours/pixel x 1 byte/colour = 720,000 bytes
         </p>
         <p>The embedding capacity will be less than that quoted above as some of the capacity
         is used up to store details of the embedded files, e.g. number of files, size of
         each file, the filenames etc. Additionally, you may not want to use the full
         capacity as the more data that is embedded the higher the potential that changes
         to the host image will be noticeable.
         </p>
